# Astraltree_example.Tree

This tree was created using [this astral tree from onekp](https://datacommons.cyverse.org/browse/iplant/home/shared/commons_repo/curated/oneKP_capstone_2019/alignments_and_trees/speciestrees/trees/upp_masked.fasta.mask10sites.mask33taxa_FAA_alltaxa-FAA/estimated_species_tree.tree). The issue with the native astral tree being that it has the four letter codes of onekp instead of species names and as such I replaced them using a python script. The script used a dict where the four letter codes were the keys and the respective species names were paired values.
